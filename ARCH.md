# üìê Architecture Document: Android SMS/MMS/RCS Sync App

## Overview

This document describes the technical architecture of the Android SMS/MMS/RCS Sync app, which listens for incoming SMS/MMS and heuristic RCS, displays them in a unified list, and later uploads them to a cloud backend. The app **does not send or modify messages**. It is designed for privacy, stability, and minimal battery impact.

---

## üß± High-Level Architecture Summary

- SMS is received via a manifest-declared `BroadcastReceiver` (`SmsReceiver`).
- MMS notifications are received via WAP push (`MmsReceiver`, `application/vnd.wap.mms-message`). Provider scans read MMS text parts (`content://mms/part`) and sender (`content://mms/<id>/addr`). RCS is heuristic via MMS DB content types and optional `content://im/chat` where available.
- Receivers trigger repository ingest on a background thread and persist directly into Room (no in-memory intermediary).
- Messages are stored in a local Room database mirroring provider fields with MMS parts/addresses.
- Foreground change detection via content observers on `content://sms` and `content://mms` (and best-effort `content://im/chat` for RCS). Manual scan and foreground polling were removed.
- Background periodic ingest via WorkManager (~15 min) catches missed broadcasts and RCS. Scheduled after boot via `BootReceiver`; `MainActivity` onStart() verifies health and reschedules only if missing/cancelled.
- A background WorkManager job will upload unsynced messages (Phase 5+)
- The UI observes the local DB and reflects changes; no manual refresh button. The UI also surfaces a "Last synced" label read from `SharedPreferences` (`lastSyncSuccessTs`) updated by `MessageSyncWorker` on success.
- Messages are deduplicated using a content-based hash.

## üì¶ Modules / Layers

### 1. SMS Receiving Layer

- Uses a manifest-declared `BroadcastReceiver` (`SmsReceiver`)
- Listens for `android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED`
- Parses sender, body, and timestamp from received messages
- Triggers ingest into Room DB via repository (off main thread)
- Future: triggers WorkManager to upload messages (Phase 5+)

**Why:** Manifest-declared receivers are the only reliable way to receive SMS in the background across all supported Android versions.

---

### 2. Local Persistence Layer

- Uses Jetpack Room ORM to store SMS/MMS/RCS data
- Schema (current implementation):
  - `messages` (Room entity `MessageEntity`)
    - `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (SHA-256 of kind + sender + body + timestamp)
    - `kind` TEXT (SMS|MMS|RCS)
    - `providerId` INTEGER NULL, `msgBox` INTEGER NULL
    - `threadId` INTEGER NULL, `address` TEXT NULL, `body` TEXT NULL
    - `timestamp` INTEGER (ms), `dateSent` INTEGER NULL (ms), `read` INTEGER NULL, `synced` INTEGER NULL (0/1; default 0)
    - `status` INTEGER NULL, `serviceCenter` TEXT NULL, `protocol` INTEGER NULL
    - `seen` INTEGER NULL, `locked` INTEGER NULL, `errorCode` INTEGER NULL
    - `subject` TEXT NULL, `mmsContentType` TEXT NULL
    - `smsJson` TEXT NULL, `mmsJson` TEXT NULL, `convJson` TEXT NULL
  - `mms_parts` (Room entity `MmsPartEntity`)
    - `partId` TEXT PRIMARY KEY, `messageId` TEXT (FK)
    - `seq` INTEGER NULL, `ct` TEXT NULL, `text` TEXT NULL
    - `data` BLOB NULL (full image bytes for image parts; used directly for small previews)
    - `dataPath` TEXT NULL, `cd` TEXT NULL, `fn` TEXT NULL
    - `name` TEXT NULL, `chset` TEXT NULL, `cid` TEXT NULL, `cl` TEXT NULL, `cttS` TEXT NULL, `cttT` TEXT NULL
    - `isImage` INTEGER NULL (0/1)
  - `mms_addr` (Room entity `MmsAddrEntity`, planned ingestion)
    - `rowId` INTEGER PK, `messageId` TEXT (FK), `address` TEXT NULL, `type` INTEGER NULL, `charset` TEXT NULL
    - All rows from `content://mms/<id>/addr` are persisted for each MMS
- UI observes a transactional relation (`@Transaction` `observeMessagesWithParts()`) via `MessageRepository.observeMessagesWithParts()` and renders small image previews from stored bytes
- MMS detailed metadata scan is performed once per ingest pass and reused for all new MMS rows
- Deduplication via `messages.id` primary key (content-based hash)
- MMS timestamps (seconds) normalized to ms for unified ordering in the repository
- Provider fields mapped into `messages` when available: `threadId`, `read`, `dateSent`, MMS `subject`

### Incremental Ingest & Permissions Gate

- On first run per kind, perform a full scan. Then incremental ingest filters by provider id per kind (new rows have `providerId > lastSeen`) using ascending, chunked `_id` queries to cover all folders (not just inbox) without arbitrary caps. Inserts are batched transactionally to minimize UI emissions and memory usage.
- Ingest runs automatically at app start (when permissions are granted). Content observers on `content://sms`, `content://mms`, and best-effort `content://im/chat` trigger ingest on changes while the app is foregrounded. The previous foreground polling loop (~10s) and manual scan button were removed.
- WorkManager performs periodic ingest in the background to catch missed broadcasts and all RCS.
- Permissions gate: if required permissions (READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS, RECEIVE_MMS, RECEIVE_WAP_PUSH) are missing, the UI renders only the explanation + request flow; list is hidden until all are granted.
- A simple concurrency guard ensures only one ingest runs at a time.
- Permissions gate: if required permissions (READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS, RECEIVE_MMS, RECEIVE_WAP_PUSH) are missing, the UI renders only the explanation + request flow; list is hidden until all are granted.

**Why:** Room provides type-safe queries, lifecycle awareness, and easy testing support.

### 3. Cloud Sync Layer

- Background sync is implemented using WorkManager
- `SmsUploadWorker` reads unsynced messages from the DB
- Messages are sent as JSON via HTTPS to the backend
- On success, the message is marked as synced
- On failure, WorkManager retries with exponential backoff
- Sync jobs are constrained to run only on available network

**Why:** WorkManager is the most battery- and API-friendly job scheduler that handles device restarts and Doze mode.

---

### 4. UI Layer

- Compose observes `MainViewModel.messages` (backed by Room Flow `observeMessagesWithParts()`) using `collectAsState()`. No manual scan button; updates come from receivers, observers, and background worker.
- UI shows:
  - List of messages
  - Sync status
  - Permission state
- Displays an onboarding flow if permissions are not yet granted

**Why:** ViewModel enables lifecycle-aware state management and clean separation of concerns.

---

### 5. Permissions UX (Phase 1)

- Uses `ActivityResultContracts.RequestMultiplePermissions` to request `RECEIVE_SMS` and `READ_SMS`, and also requests `RECEIVE_MMS` and `RECEIVE_WAP_PUSH` at runtime.
- Shows basic status UI and request button
- Future: rationale UI and settings redirect if denied

**Why:** Respecting runtime permissions is essential for user trust and Play Store compliance.

---

### 6. Settings & Configuration

- Stores settings in `SharedPreferences`
- Configurable options:
  - Enable/disable cloud sync
  - Clear history
  - (Optional) Change API endpoint for staging vs. production

**Why:** SharedPreferences are ideal for simple key-value configuration.

---

### 7. Deduplication Strategy

- Messages are uniquely identified by `SHA-256(kind + sender + body + timestamp)`
- Hash is used as the primary key in Room
- Hash is sent with cloud uploads to prevent re-processing

**Why:** SMS IDs vary between Android versions and devices ‚Äî content-based hashes are more reliable.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Notes

- Ingestion concurrency guard via `AtomicBoolean` to prevent overlapping runs.
- MMS parts/addresses are fetched on-demand per new MMS instead of bulk-prefetching to reduce UI update latency.
- RCS timestamps are normalized to ms; Samsung provider timestamps are used rather than `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
- Room destructive migrations allowed during pre-release via `fallbackToDestructiveMigration(true)`.

---

## üîÑ Sync Workflow

1. SMS is received and parsed
2. Stored in Room DB if not already present (hash-based check)
3. WorkManager is triggered with the new message
4. Upload is attempted
5. On success, `synced = true` is saved in DB
6. UI updates via reactive DB observation

---

## üìä Data Model

### `SmsMessageEntity` (Room)

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "sms_messages")
data class SmsMessageEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String, // SHA-256 hash of sender + timestamp + body
    val sender: String,
    val body: String,
    val timestamp: Long, // epoch milliseconds
    val synced: Boolean = false
)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

The app will be tested across multiple layers to ensure correctness, stability, and reliability. The goal is to isolate logic, minimize manual QA, and automate where possible.

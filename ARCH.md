# üìê Architecture Document: Android SMS Sync App

## Overview

This document describes the technical architecture of the Android SMS Sync app, which listens for incoming SMS messages on Android devices and uploads them to a cloud backend. The app **does not send or modify SMS messages**. It is designed for privacy, stability, and minimal battery impact.

---

## üß± High-Level Architecture Summary

- SMS will be received via a manifest-declared `BroadcastReceiver` (Phase 2+)
- SMS will be received via a manifest-declared `BroadcastReceiver` (Phase 2+). Implemented as `SmsReceiver` pushing into `SmsInMemoryStore` for now.
- MMS notifications will be received via WAP push (`MmsReceiver`) and surfaced minimally; a manual provider scan reads MMS text parts (`content://mms/part`) and sender (`content://mms/<id>/addr`). RCS is heuristic via MMS DB content types and optional `content://im/chat` where available.
- Messages will be stored in a local Room database (Phase 4+)
- A background WorkManager job will upload unsynced messages (Phase 5+)
- The UI will observe the local DB and reflect sync status (Phase 4+)
- Messages will be deduplicated using a content-based hash (Phase 4+)

## üì¶ Modules / Layers

### 1. SMS Receiving Layer

- Uses a manifest-declared `BroadcastReceiver` (`SmsReceiver`)
- Listens for `android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED`
- Parses sender, body, and timestamp from received messages
- Triggers WorkManager to upload messages
- Persists message in Room DB

**Why:** Manifest-declared receivers are the only reliable way to receive SMS in the background across all supported Android versions.

---

### 2. Local Persistence Layer

- Uses Jetpack Room ORM to store SMS data
- Messages are stored in a `SmsMessageEntity` table
- A SHA-256 hash of `(sender + body + timestamp)` is used as the primary key
- `LiveData` or `StateFlow` is used to observe changes from the UI

**Why:** Room provides type-safe queries, lifecycle awareness, and easy testing support.

---

### 3. Cloud Sync Layer

- Background sync is implemented using WorkManager
- `SmsUploadWorker` reads unsynced messages from the DB
- Messages are sent as JSON via HTTPS to the backend
- On success, the message is marked as synced
- On failure, WorkManager retries with exponential backoff
- Sync jobs are constrained to run only on available network

**Why:** WorkManager is the most battery- and API-friendly job scheduler that handles device restarts and Doze mode.

---

### 4. UI Layer

- Built using MVVM: ViewModel + LiveData or StateFlow. For Phase 2, Compose directly observes a `StateFlow` from `SmsInMemoryStore` using `collectAsState()`. A manual "Scan SMS/MMS/RCS" button calls `MessageScanner` to query providers (SMS inbox, MMS + parts/addr, and heuristic RCS).
- UI shows:
  - List of messages
  - Sync status
  - Permission state
- Displays an onboarding flow if permissions are not yet granted

**Why:** ViewModel enables lifecycle-aware state management and clean separation of concerns.

---

### 5. Permissions UX (Phase 1)

- Uses `ActivityResultContracts.RequestMultiplePermissions` to request `RECEIVE_SMS` and `READ_SMS`, and also requests `RECEIVE_MMS` and `RECEIVE_WAP_PUSH` at runtime.
- Shows basic status UI and request button
- Future: rationale UI and settings redirect if denied

**Why:** Respecting runtime permissions is essential for user trust and Play Store compliance.

---

### 6. Settings & Configuration

- Stores settings in `SharedPreferences`
- Configurable options:
  - Enable/disable cloud sync
  - Clear history
  - (Optional) Change API endpoint for staging vs. production

**Why:** SharedPreferences are ideal for simple key-value configuration.

---

### 7. Deduplication Strategy

- Messages are uniquely identified by `SHA-256(sender + timestamp + body)`
- Hash is used as the primary key in Room
- Hash is sent with cloud uploads to prevent re-processing

**Why:** SMS IDs vary between Android versions and devices ‚Äî content-based hashes are more reliable.

---

## üîÑ Sync Workflow

1. SMS is received and parsed
2. Stored in Room DB if not already present (hash-based check)
3. WorkManager is triggered with the new message
4. Upload is attempted
5. On success, `synced = true` is saved in DB
6. UI updates via reactive DB observation

---

## üìä Data Model

### `SmsMessageEntity` (Room)

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "sms_messages")
data class SmsMessageEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String, // SHA-256 hash of sender + timestamp + body
    val sender: String,
    val body: String,
    val timestamp: Long, // epoch milliseconds
    val synced: Boolean = false
)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

The app will be tested across multiple layers to ensure correctness, stability, and reliability. The goal is to isolate logic, minimize manual QA, and automate where possible.

### ‚úÖ CI Recommendations

- Run unit tests on every PR (GitHub Actions or Bitrise)
- Lint + formatting checks (`ktlint`, `detekt`)
- Optionally run instrumented tests on emulator matrix (API 23+)

**Test Coverage Priorities:**

1. Deduplication logic (core integrity requirement)
2. Upload retry logic (resilience)
3. DB queries (sync state correctness)
4. Receiver and Worker behaviors
5. ViewModel state flow (user experience)

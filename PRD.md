# üì± Android SMS Sync App ‚Äì Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

**Goal:**  
Create a lightweight Android app that listens for incoming SMS messages and uploads them to a cloud backend. The app will **not send or write** SMS messages ‚Äî only read and transmit.

**Platform:** Android  
**Minimum SDK:** 23 (Android 6.0)  
**Permissions Required:**  
- `RECEIVE_SMS`
- `READ_SMS`
- `INTERNET`

---

## üß≠ Phase Roadmap

Each phase builds upon the last. You can build and test after every phase.

---

### üü¢ Phase 1 ‚Äì Bootstrap & Permission Setup

**Objective:** Basic app with UI that requests SMS permissions.

**Requirements:**
- Set `minSdkVersion = 23`
- Request `RECEIVE_SMS` and `READ_SMS` at runtime
- UI:
  - Button: "Request SMS Permissions"
  - Text: Permission status (`Granted` / `Denied`)

**Deliverable:**  
App requests permissions and displays the result. Implemented in `MainActivity` with Compose UI. Manifest declares `RECEIVE_SMS`, `READ_SMS`, and `INTERNET`.

---

### üü° Phase 2 ‚Äì Log Received SMS/MMS in UI

**Objective:** Show SMS received via `BroadcastReceiver`.

**Requirements:**
- Register a `BroadcastReceiver` for `android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED`
- Parse sender + body from each received message
- Append message to an in-app list (RecyclerView or simple list)
- Register a `BroadcastReceiver` for MMS notifications (`WAP_PUSH_RECEIVED` with `application/vnd.wap.mms-message`) and surface a minimal entry
- Add a manual "Scan SMS/MMS/RCS" button to query `content://sms` (inbox), `content://mms` (+ `content://mms/part`, `content://mms/<id>/addr`), and heuristically surface RCS (incl. best-effort `content://im/chat` where accessible)

**Deliverable:**  
SMS and MMS notifications appear in UI as they arrive (even in background). Implemented via manifest `SmsReceiver`/`MmsReceiver` pushing into an in-memory `StateFlow` consumed by Compose UI with `collectAsState()`. Manual scan shows recent SMS, MMS (text parts + sender), and any heuristic RCS entries.

---

### üü† Phase 3 ‚Äì Read Existing Inbox SMS

**Objective:** Load SMS history from `content://sms/inbox`.

**Requirements:**
- Button: "Load SMS History"
- Query inbox and display messages (sender, body, timestamp)
- Combine with live received messages
- Sort messages by timestamp (descending)

**Deliverable:**  
App shows historical and live messages together.

---

### üîµ Phase 4 ‚Äì Add Local Persistence (Optional)

**Objective:** Store messages on device for reload after app restart.

**Requirements:**
- Store SMS/MMS/RCS messages in Room using a unified schema with satellite tables:
  - `messages`
    - `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (SHA-256 of kind + sender + body + timestamp)
    - `kind` TEXT (SMS|MMS|RCS)
    - `threadId` INTEGER NULL
    - `address` TEXT NULL
    - `body` TEXT NULL
    - `timestamp` INTEGER (ms since epoch)
    - `dateSent` INTEGER NULL (ms since epoch)
    - `read` INTEGER NULL (0/1)
    - `smsJson` TEXT NULL (raw SMS row JSON if desired)
    - `mmsJson` TEXT NULL (raw MMS row JSON if desired)
    - `convJson` TEXT NULL (raw conversations row JSON if desired)
  - `mms_parts`
    - `partId` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (MMS part id)
    - `messageId` TEXT NOT NULL (FK ‚Üí messages.id)
    - `seq` INTEGER NULL
    - `ct` TEXT NULL (MIME type, e.g. text/plain, image/jpeg)
    - `text` TEXT NULL (for text parts)
    - `data` BLOB NULL (full bytes for image parts; used for UI thumbnails)
    - `name` TEXT NULL, `chset` TEXT NULL, `cid` TEXT NULL, `cl` TEXT NULL, `cttS` TEXT NULL, `cttT` TEXT NULL
    - `isImage` INTEGER NULL (0/1 convenience flag)
  - `mms_addr`
    - `rowId` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
    - `messageId` TEXT NOT NULL (FK ‚Üí messages.id)
    - `address` TEXT NULL
    - `type` INTEGER NULL (137=from, 151=to, 130=cc)
    - `charset` TEXT NULL
- Load stored messages via Room Flow on startup; UI observes `@Transaction` relation (messages + parts)
- Prevent duplicates via primary-key hash
- MMS date (seconds) normalized to ms for unified ordering
- Optional: "Clear History" button

**Deliverable:**  
SMS list persists across app restarts.

---

### üü£ Phase 5 ‚Äì Background Upload Worker (Cloud Sync)

**Objective:** Send new messages to backend in background.

**Requirements:**
- Cloud endpoint: `POST /messages`
- Use WorkManager to enqueue upload job
- Send payload: `{ sender, body, timestamp }`
- Use network constraint: `NetworkType.CONNECTED`
- Retry failed uploads (exponential backoff)
- Optional: indicate upload success/failure in UI

**Deliverable:**  
Incoming SMS are uploaded to the cloud, even when app is backgrounded.

---

### üü§ Phase 6 ‚Äì Bulk Upload & Sync State

**Objective:** Support delayed/batched sync and deduplication.

**Requirements:**
- Store last uploaded timestamp or hash
- On startup, query new messages and upload in batch
- Prevent duplicate uploads (backend or client-side)
- Sync jobs run on schedule or manual trigger

**Deliverable:**  
Only new messages are uploaded. Missed uploads sync automatically.

---

### ‚ö™ Phase 7 ‚Äì UI Polish & Config

**Objective:** Add user-facing controls and polish.

**Requirements:**
- Settings screen:
  - "Enable Cloud Sync" toggle
  - "Clear History" button
- Optional:
  - Message sync status
  - Total synced count

**Deliverable:**  
Basic but clean UX with minimal configuration options.

---

## üìê Non-Functional Requirements

- Must work while app is backgrounded or inactive
- Efficient battery and network usage (via WorkManager)
- Gracefully handle:
  - Permission denial
  - No network connection
- No unnecessary access (e.g., contacts or SMS sending)

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

This PRD breaks the app into self-contained phases with increasing functionality. You can ship early, test often, and refactor later without overcommitting to architecture from day one.

Please review @PRD.md and @ARCHITECTURE.md. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. Provide an analysis. What should these files cover? What's in them? Any repetition or
extra stuff, anything missing? Opportunities for improvement. Imagine you're a senior engineering manager in charge of the project. What would you
possibly change in each?                                                                                                                                   
Please read ALL THE PRODUCTION CODE ON DISK AS IT IS TODAY. Explain what other changes are needed in ARCHITECTURE.md or CLAUDE.md. Veirfy whether PRD.md
is up to date based on what's on disk today. Enumerate all technical debt and refactoring ideas you have.
DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. Just report back after reading all the production code on disk. Enumerate this
plan back to me as the first step.
